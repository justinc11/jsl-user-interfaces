## Abstract  
The  user  interface  of  an  application  should  be  easy  to  understand  and  use.Good  user  interfaces  will  result  in  engaged  users,  fewer  frustrations  and  great  user  experiences. JMP®  provides  the  ability  to  create  user  interfaces  with  the  Application  Builder  or  manually  using  dialog  boxes  created  using  JSL. There  is  a  wealth  of  literature  on  designing  a  good  user  interface;  this  talk  will  focus  on  how  to  supercharge  your  user  interfaces  using  a  variety  of  techniques  in  JSL. 

JMP®  provides  the  ability  to  display  and  interact  with  a  grid  of  values.    Most  people  are  familiar  with  using  JMP’s  data  table  for  this.    If  you  delve  into  JMP’s  JSL  scripting  language  you  will  discover  that  you  can  do  similar  things  by  using  an  object  called  a  Table  Box.    You  can  populate  a  Table  Box  with  the  String  Col  Box,  String  Col  Edit  Box,  Number  Col  Box,  Number  Col  Edit  Box,  Check  Box  and  Radio  Box  objects.

What  if  you  want  to  display  text  in  different  fonts,  styles,  sizes,  foreground/background  colors  in  the  grid?    What  if  you  want  to  display  a  column  of  clickable  buttons?    What  if  you  want  to  display  a  column  of  icons  representing  the  status  of  a  row?    Or  how  about  a  column  of  mini-graphs?    Enter  the  Col  Box  to  the  rescue!    The  Col  Box  is  a  special  type  of  column  object  that  can  contain  any  other  display  box.    Having  this  ability  allows  you  to  improve  the  user  interfaces  of  your  applications. 

This  talk  will  show  numerous  examples  of  how  to  use  the  Col  Box  display  object,  as  well  as  an  implementation  in  a  real-world  application  that  greatly  improved  usability. In  addition,  we  will  show  other  supercharging  techniques  including  

* Using  icons  in  buttons  and  menus  for  more  intuitive  actions  
* Using  hover-help  or  tooltips  
* Using  tabs  to  declutter  things  
* Providing  search  functionality  for  long  picklists  to  speed  selection
